🌍 Climate Risk Mapping: AI-Powered Prediction & Forecasting
🚀 Project Overview

Imagine knowing which areas are at risk of floods or droughts before they happen.
This project uses Machine Learning to map climate risks and forecast future hazards using historical climate data.
It’s like giving governments and communities a crystal ball for climate disasters! 🔮

💡 Why This Project?

Climate change increases the frequency of extreme weather events.

Early risk prediction can save lives, protect property, and guide resources efficiently.

Combines AI + environmental science to create actionable insights.

📊 Dataset Highlights

A synthetic dataset (climate_risk_data_large.csv) with 50,000 samples:

Feature	Description
Temperature (°C)	Daily average
Rainfall (mm)	Precipitation levels
Humidity (%)	Moisture in air
WindSpeed (km/h)	Wind strength
TopographyScore (1–10)	Landscape elevation and slope
PopulationDensity	People per km²
FloodRiskScore (0–1)	Likelihood of flood
DroughtRiskScore (0–1)	Likelihood of drought

⚡ Tip: You can swap in real NASA/NOAA climate datasets for production-grade predictions.
