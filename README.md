Climate Risk Mapping: Predictive Analysis and Forecasting Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project aims to predict climate-related risks such as floods and droughts using machine learning models. By analyzing historical climate and environmental data, the system identifies high-risk areas and forecasts potential future risks, helping governments, organizations, and communities make data-driven decisions for disaster preparedness and mitigation.

Features

Predicts FloodRiskScore and DroughtRiskScore based on climate and environmental factors.

Uses Random Forest Regressor for accurate prediction.

Provides feature importance analysis to identify key risk factors.

Supports future risk forecasting using new climate data.

Easily scalable to include additional climate hazards.

Dataset

The project uses a synthetic dataset named climate_risk_data_large.csv (50,000 rows).

Columns include:

Temperature (°C)

Rainfall (mm)

Humidity (%)

WindSpeed (km/h)

TopographyScore (1–10)

PopulationDensity (people/km²)

FloodRiskScore (0–1)

DroughtRiskScore (0–1)

Real datasets from sources like NASA POWER, NOAA, and Kaggle can also be integrated for better accuracy.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib

Machine Learning Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Steps to Run the Project

Install required libraries

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib


Load dataset

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("climate_risk_data_large.csv")


Train and evaluate the model
Run the climate_risk_model.py script. It will:

Preprocess data

Train the Random Forest model

Evaluate performance (MSE, R²)

Display feature importance

Predict future risks

Save the model for future use

import joblib
joblib.dump(model, "models/climate_risk_model.pkl")

Results

Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score are used for evaluation.

Feature importance identifies the most influential factors affecting flood and drought risks.

Future predictions can be made by providing new climate data.

Conclusion

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning for climate risk prediction.

Enables data-driven disaster management, helping authorities take preventive measures.

Can be further extended to real-time monitoring, GIS mapping, and inclusion of additional climate hazards.

Future Enhancements

Integrate real-time climate sensor data.

Include other hazards like heatwaves, storms, and landslides.

Deploy a web dashboard for interactive visualization.

Use LSTM or Prophet for better time-series forecasting.
